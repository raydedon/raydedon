Hi

I went through the job description and about your company. I would love to be part of your team. 
I am a storyteller and a Javascript enthusiast. I am currently spearheading the role of a Principal developer at an e-commerce company, Advance Auto Parts, Hyderabad. In my 12+ years of experience in mobile and web development, I have always worked in startups to build meaningful software products. As a full-stack developer, I have worn multiple hats to get things done, but react javascript, and visualization excite me the most. 

I have B1/B2 visa approved for the USA.

I can join Immediately.

Following are achievements or accomplishments, which is worth mentioning:-
1. Built a high-performing team here at Advance Auto Parts. It includes actively hiring and mentoring team members.
2. Optimized the performance of our e-commerce web app. This involved the following steps:-
	a. upgraded to http2 servers on nginx. This helped us in leveraging the benefit of http2 like server push, request multiplexing, and reduced header size.
	b. iteratively improving the core web vitals score. thereby leading to an improved SEO ranking.

3. looked into the security aspect of the e-commerce application. Implemented CSP, and Snyk scans.

4. single-handedly delivered all the visualization projects on d3. Some of the graphs I have put out in the open at https://www.willsnvision.com/. I have also developed a few more advanced visualization graphs which are not mentioned here.

5. Prototyped and currently developing voice and video calls using Webrtc.

6. Implemented login via Google and Facebook using Oauth2(Auth code, Implicit, and client credential grant types).

How will I add value to your org:-

3. Building a high-performance team by hiring new candidates and constantly mentoring junior folks.
4. I can be a great help to the company in terms of front-end technology. I have done a humongous amount of work that is front-end intensive. In terms of the front-end, you can rely 101% on me.
